    The goal of this project is to develop a Groovy Builder that simplifies creating charts from the
    Groovy language. GroovyChart is based on the Groovy builder paradigm, and applies it to the well known
    <a href="http://www.jfree.org">JFreeChart</a> library.
</p>
<p>
  From a code perspective, most of the underlying charting library is covered. However, there is little documentation
  at the moment on how to use the library. Currently, the plan is to provide a series of example builders as time goes
  by that show how to use each kind of graph, these will include as much of the cases as possible.
</p>
<h3>Snapshot releases</h3>
<p>
  We are currently releasing snapshots that have the most recent functionality available.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="snapshots/groovychart-100306-snap.zip">10-Mar-2010 latest snapshot release</a></li>
    <li><a href="snapshots/groovychart-080508-snap.zip">08-May-2008 OLD snapshot release</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<img class="chartpic" align="right" alt="Example bar chart" src="images/chart.jpeg">
<p>In order to get started you will need:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A Java runtime, that can support Groovy 1.6 (see <a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>)</li>
    <li>An Installation of Groovy - we recommend 1.6 or above(see <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org">http://groovy.codehaus.org</a>)</li>
    <li>GroovyChart package available from here, which includes <a href="http://www.jfree.org">JFreeChart</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Optionally</b> an IDE such as IntelliJ, Eclipse or NetBeans with groovy support installed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Once you've got all the above packages unzip the groovychart snapshot zip into a suitable location.
    Next open $GROOVY_HOME/conf/groovy-starter.conf and on a new line at the end add the following line:
</p>
<pre>
    load $GROOVYCHART_HOME/lib/*.jar
</pre>
<p>
    This will allow you to use the groovychart libraries directly from either the Groovy Console or from
    the groovy script runner. To run the examples provided, change directory to $GROOVYCHART_HOME/examples
    and issue the command:
</p>
<pre>
    groovy PieChartDemo.groovy
</pre>
<p>
    To load one of the examples into the interactive groovy console UI, simply run <code>groovyConsole</code>
    and select open from the file menu. Then, you can modify the script and run it directly from here.
</p>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>
    Although we aim to provide great documentation for GroovyChart, we're not there yet. Anyway, you can get
    a long way by understanding what its based on. I can recommend the resources available at
    <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/">JFreeChart</a>. A good starting point is to download
    the JFreeChart DeveloperGuide($$$), but this is not necessary to run GroovyChart.
</p>
<h3>Examples of usage</h3>
<p><a href="examples.html">Examples of using the library</a></p>

<h3>To-do list</h3>
<p>Future development:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="taskdone">Complete the implementation such that most chart types are supported</li>
    <li>Ensure that the plot and renderer functions work for all types</li>
    <li>Generate a complete set of Groovy demo scripts</li>
    <li>Provide a reference map, showing all the charts, plots, renderers and compatibility</li>
</ul>
